# ARC-OPS-001 — Collaboration Operating Model

## Layer: Operational Collaboration  
## Type: Architecture (Source of Truth)

---

# 1. Objective

Define how communication flows inside the tenant across:

- departments
- roles
- tools (Teams + Outlook)

This layer ensures:

```text
Right message → Right place → Right time → Right owner
````

---

# 2. Core Principle

Collaboration is NOT random.

It follows structured flows:

```text
Department → Channel → Owner → Action
```

---

# 3. Communication Channels Model

## 3.1 Primary Channels

| Channel Type                    | Tool             | Purpose                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Internal team work              | Teams            | daily collaboration      |
| Cross-department coordination   | Teams channels   | operational sync         |
| External/customer communication | Shared Mailboxes | controlled communication |
| Escalations / traceability      | Outlook          | structured workflows     |

---

## 3.2 Rule

```text
Teams = collaboration  
Mailboxes = responsibility + ownership  
```

---

# 4. Department Interaction Model

## 4.1 Standard Flow

```text
Customer → Support → Operations → Warehouse → Resolution
```

---

## 4.2 Ownership Logic

| Stage        | Owner      |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Intake       | Support    |
| Coordination | Operations |
| Execution    | Warehouse  |
| Closure      | Support    |

---

## 4.3 Rule

```text
Each step has ONE owner  
Never multiple accountability
```

---

# 5. Teams Collaboration Model

## 5.1 Structure

Each department has:

```text
Team = Department
Channels = Functions
```

---

## 5.2 Example (Operations)

```text
OPS Team
├── General
├── Dispatch
├── Customer Issues
├── Warehouse Coordination
└── Delays / Incidents
```

---

## 5.3 Cross-Department Access

Allowed ONLY when:

```text
Role requires coordination
```

Example:

```text
ROLE-WHS-LEAD → access to OPS: Warehouse Coordination channel
```

---

## 5.4 Rule

```text
Do NOT duplicate teams  
Use channels for integration
```

---

# 6. Mailbox Collaboration Model

## 6.1 Purpose

Shared Mailboxes represent:

```text
Functional entry points
```

Examples:

```text
support@
operations@
warehouse@
finance@
```

---

## 6.2 Internal Workflow

Mailboxes must support:

```text
- triage
- categorization
- forwarding
- ownership tracking
```

---

## 6.3 Folder Model

```text
01-New
02-Triage
03-In Progress
04-Waiting
05-Closed
```

---

## 6.4 Categories (Tags)

```text
CAT-OPS
CAT-WHS
CAT-FIN
CAT-URGENT
CAT-WAITING
```

---

# 7. Action Model (Critical)

## 7.1 Standard Actions

Users must be able to:

```text
Forward → Assign → Categorize → Escalate
```

---

## 7.2 Example Flow

```text
Support receives complaint
→ Categorize CAT-OPS
→ Forward to operations@
→ Move to "Sent to OPS"
```

Operations:

```text
→ Review
→ Assign to WHS
→ Notify via Teams channel
```

---

# 8. Integration Model (Teams + Mail)

## 8.1 Rule

```text
Email = trigger  
Teams = execution
```

---

## 8.2 Example

```text
Email arrives → categorized  
→ Teams notification triggered  
→ handled in channel
```

---

# 9. Governance Rules

## 9.1 Ownership

```text
Each mailbox has:
- Primary owner
- Secondary backup
```

---

## 9.2 Accountability

```text
If no owner → process fails
```

---

## 9.3 Restrictions

```text
No uncontrolled forwarding  
No personal mailbox routing  
No parallel ownership
```

---

# 10. Design Constraints

## 10.1 Simplicity First

```text
Avoid over-automation early
```

---

## 10.2 Scalability

Model must support:

```text
10 → 50 → 200 users
```

---

## 10.3 Separation

```text
Structure (ARCH) ≠ Implementation (BLP)
```

---

BLP-OPS-002 — Outlook Workflow Blueprint  
BLP-OPS-003 — Department Handoff Blueprint  
```

---

# 12. Final Principle

```text
Good collaboration = visible + structured + owned
```

# 🧠 Notas rápidas

- Esto ya es **nivel empresa real**
- No es teoría → es operativo
- Te habilita después a generar MTX de:
  - channels
  - workflows
  - categories
  - folders
